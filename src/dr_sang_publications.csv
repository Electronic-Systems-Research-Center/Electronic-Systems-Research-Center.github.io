Since slew rate is one of the major required parameters in many interfacing protocols, it is really hard to meet if the mixed-voltage output buffer is needed in FinFET processes. The major reason is the low VDD in these advanced processes. However, our buffer's SR is improved by implementing low threshold voltage (Vth) type of device for always-on driving transistors in the Output Stage, thereby increasing the output current. Moreover, since FinFET devices were used in the buffer, the stability of the gate drives of the said driving transistors must be ensured so that noise interference will be avoided. Lastly, the buffer's Timing Shifters used non-overlapping signaling control directly implemented at the transistor level to eliminate the errors caused by delay variations. Based on silicon measurement results, at a load capacitance of 20 pF, the said circuit can be operated at a maximum data rate of 250 MHz for both supply voltages of 0.8 and 1.6 V (namely external VDD or VDDIO), respectively. When the SR auto-adjustment is activated, the SR improvement is at least 49.2% and 37.5% for 0.8 and 1.6 V, respectively."

Many papers used different MPPT methods that enhance PV harvesting that require ADC and MCU which is costly and also requires a long period of tracking. A high-voltage energy harvesting circuit with adaptive constant current (ACC), constant voltage (CV), and maximum power tracking (MPPT) control for 20V/ 5 W solar panels is proposed to carry out the constant current charging (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging modes of lithium-ion batteries when the solar panel’s maximum power point changes.

The ACC mode controlled by perturb-and-observe (PBO) MPPT algorithm improved the efficiency during insufficient light source or low battery power. When the battery is fully charged, the over-charging damage is prevented to the lithium-ion battery when CV mode is activated. TSMC 0.5-μm UHV process is used to fabricate the energy harvesting circuit. For the photocurrent range of 0.1 A to 0.3 A, this design achieved a peak efficiency of 98%."
