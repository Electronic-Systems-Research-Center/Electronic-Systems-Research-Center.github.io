"A metastable RNG using interleaved NAND-and NOR-based TEROs","February 9, 2024","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21681724.2024.2312551","Long Run Test","Metastable","Transient Effect Ring Oscillator","Journal","This study introduces a novel approach to address the limitations observed in existing random number generator (RNG) designs, focusing on the resolution for insufficiently covered problem statements and study purposes.","In response to these challenges, we propose a high-throughput metastable-based RNG tailored for cryptography applications. Our design is featured with a two-layer transient effect ring oscillator (TERO) architecture, meticulously crafted to mitigate the locking phenomenon and enhance RNG randomness. Leveraging interleaved two-layer TEROs, realised through NAND and NOR SR latches, our RNG achieves unpredictable irregular sampling, crucial for cryptographic applications. To further enhance irregular sampling, the first layer of the RNG employs a multiplexer that selects inputs randomly. This multiplexer is governed by selection signals generated by the second layer of the RNG, ensuring superior randomness. Implemented using TSMC 40-nm CMOS process, our RNG passed the FIPS 140–1 randomness test at a clock frequency of 100 MHz, boasting a remarkable throughput of 50 Mbps. This study represents a significant advancement in RNG technology, addressing previous shortcomings and paving the way for high-speed communication systems’ secure cryptographic applications."
"A 2.71 fJ/conversion-step 10-bit 50 MSPS split-capacitor array SAR ADC for FOG systems","November 2, 2023","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207217.2022.2118861","ADC","SAR","Fibre Optic Gyroscope","Journal","This investigation demonstrates a 10-bit SAR-ADC with low power dissipation per conversion step at 50 MS/s sampling rate.","The proposed ADC is featured with the split-capacitance array by using unity-gain amplifiers and designed for fibre optic gyroscope (FOG) systems. The buffers based on the unity-gain amplifiers replace the bridge capacitors of the split-capacitance array in conventional SAR ADCs to resist process variation and enhance linearity of the capacitor-array. Aside from those, improvements in time response, that is, settling time, and capacitor size have also been proved. The design was implemented using a typical 40-nm CMOS process. The INL (integral non-linearity) and the DNL (differential non-linearity) were found to be 0.56 LSB and 0.51 LSB, respectively. The SNDR and SFDR are 51.23 dB and 61.46 dB, respectively, at an input of 12.5 MHz showing ENOB to be 9.79 bits at a sampling rate of 50 MS/s."
