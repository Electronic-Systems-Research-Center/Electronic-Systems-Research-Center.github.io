            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">
                Underwater monitoring technology is crucial for studying aquatic life, particularly in mangrove ecosystems, which are vital to marine biodiversity.
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    However, these environments present challenges such as limited power supply and frequent manual battery replacements. 
                    To address these issues, a renewable energy-powered supply system was developed for a submersible camera tailored for
                    use in mangrove ecosystems. Various energy sources, including solar, wind, and wave energy, were evaluated, with the
                    most suitable option selected based on energy availability and environmental compatibility. The waterproof 
                    prototype was designed for durability and ease of maintenance and tested initially in a controlled pool environment,
                    followed by field deployment in the Lobo, Batangas mangrove area in the Philippines. Key performance aspects, 
                    including waterproofing, energy efficiency, and maintenance, were assessed. The system used a commercial utility
                    box with silicone sealant to ensure waterproofing, and voltage and current measurements confirmed the reliable 
                    energy supply under varied load conditions. Results demonstrate the system’s capability to meet continuous camera 
                    energy needs with minimal intervention, offering an effective solution for long-term underwater monitoring in
                    mangrove ecosystems.

                Intellectual Properties like Patents, Utility Models, Industrial Designs, and Copyrights are considered the 
                drivers of today’s modern knowledge-based economy.
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    The number of registered and granted Intellectual Properties is one key performance indicator of a state in
                    advancing science and technology. Thus, analyzing the trends is vital as it sets directions for the state. 
                    This study aims to analyze the patent trends in the International Patent Classification by incorporating 
                    various classical statistical-based techniques and algorithms in time series forecasting. This leads to 
                    the generation of insight into the present and future of registered and granted intellectual properties.
                    Autoregression, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average and Holt Winter’s Exponential Smoothing
                    are the classical time series forecasting algorithms that were compared using three performance indicators,
                    i.e., Root Mean Square Errors, Mean Absolute Errors, and the Coefficient of Determination. It was concluded
                    that the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average achieved a high performance of several indicators
                     per section. However, it is vital to consider the behaviour of the present data and the appropriate time series

                Design and Simulation of Short Circuit Fault Detection in DC Power Supply using 
                Daubechies Wavelet and Convolutional Neural Networks
            </h3>

            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">
                Power supply systems are an essential component of current infrastructure and must operate reliably. 
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    Short-circuit defects pose a danger to power supply stability and may potentially result in equipment damage 
                    and system outages. This research presents a novel approach for predicting and detecting short circuit faults 
                    in power supply systems by combining the Daubechies wavelet transform with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
                    The researcher will make use of MATLAB Simulink and focuses on the design and simulation with short circuit faults 
                    introduced at known points of linear power supplies, boost converters, and buck converters. The voltage and current 
                    from the simulations were exported and then fed to Python with the use of PyWavelet for mathematical analysis. 
                    The researcher will make use of the db4 transform for the Daubechies wavelet. This decomposes the signals into 
                    detail coefficients at various scales, which are then converted into 1D vectors to be flattened and used for 
                    training with CNN. Based on the data and results, this shows 94.22% accuracy and 94.67% mAP (mean average precision) 
                    at 35 epochs. The researchers concluded that this study was feasible and reliable for implementation in real-world 
                    scenarios.

                    was realized and fabricated using TSMC 40-nm CMOS process. Not only the post-layout simulation results are shown,
                    the on-silicon measurement outcome is also demonstrated to prove the function correctness and the performance.
                    The area efficiency (GOPS/mm2) is 4.562, and the power efficiency (TOPS/W) is 0.5668 on silicon, which both 
                    are the best to date.

                    It uses the single-ended SRAM cell as a memory unit and a single-ended comparison circuit.

                    presented in this investigation. The proposed CAM is implemented using the typical TSMC 40-nm CMOS logic process.
                    It has an area of 1.4 × 1.4 mm2 with a core of 0.89 mm2. Simulation results show that the energy per bit per search
                    is 0.938 fJ with a search time of 0.47 ns. An FOM comparison based on the search time, energy per bit per search,

                This paper presents a design of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) with a build-in PVT 
                (process, voltage, temperature) variation sensor using a 40-nm CMOS process.
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    The DCO is designed using a 128-stage differential ring oscillator wherein the number of stages is
                    being controlled by an input of 7-bit digital code. It is further realized using serpentine style
                    arrangement to minimize variation on wafer. A multiplexed PVT sensor is integrated to provide a way
                    to feedback for output correction using any auto-calibration strategy, e.g., PID control or artificial
                    intelligent control. A linearized model of the DCO is presented based on the results of the post-layout
                    simulations. The DCO has a dynamic range of 9.9 MHz to 527.43 MHz. The DCO is designed to operate at the
                    frequencies –20 °C to 75 °C. The overall chip consumes 0.235 mW from a 0.9 V supply. The overall chip area
                    is 0.67 mm2 with a core area of 0.05 mm2. The all-PVT-corner post-layout simulations show a highly linear
                    fit for the period vs. input code with the worst R2 of 0.992 in the SS corner at 0.99 V supply and 25 °C.

            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">
                In this paper an FPGA-based radio transceiver that operates on a frequency band from unused TV white space - specifically 512 MHz - 518 MHz - is presented. 
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    The investigation was done to introduce an application of TV white space and FPGA hardware in creating a 
                    communication system for disaster rescue operations and in hopes of being used as material for further
                    research. The transceiver used an FPGA Arty7-35T board which was programmed using the Verilog HDL.
                    A QPSK scheme of modulation/demodulation was utilized to maximize the performance of the transceiver
                    while considering the resources available from the chosen board. The transceiver was designed using
                    model- based design approach and was implemented on FPGA. Appropriate functionality and performance
                    tests were conducted. These include RTL schematic analysis and Verilog test benches, and evaluation
                    of the bit-error-rate, signal-to- noise ratio, and root mean squared error. Finally, the transceiver's
                    performance was assessed to have a BER of < 1, an RMSE of < 0.1 and an SNR of 24.3 dB.

                    However, the current curriculum doesn't emphasize telecommunications, making LTE principles difficult for
                    students to understand. To address this issue, researchers developed a 4G LTE learning system using MATLAB
                    LTE Toolbox. MATLAB's Live Scripts, Scripts, and App Designer implement nine lab experiments. A course framework
                    was devised, encompassing essential competencies and laboratory experiments to teach LTE fundamentals.
                    Additionally, a laboratory manual and instructor's guide were provided to support and assess the experiments.
                    The manual's content, layout, and general satisfaction were all factors in the assessments made by both teachers
                    and students.

                Schmitt-Trigger-Based Low Power SRAM Implemented Using 45-nm CMOS Technology
            </h3>

            <!-- Collapsible Text -->
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">
                This paper presents a Schmitt-trigger-based SRAM with a separated read port, which significantly improves read static noise margin (RSNM) and consumes low energy. 
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    Post-layout simulation results show that the proposed design performed better than the conventional
                    6T SRAM cell. The SNM of the designed cell is 1.16 mV higher than the conventional 6T SRAM cell in
                    write mode, and 232.37 mV and 207.46 mV in read mode 1 and 0, respectively. The impact of the process,
                    voltage, and temperature variations on cell performance parameters such as read, write and hold SNM, power per
                    access, power per bit, delay, and energy per bit was investigated. Aside from this, the DNM of the cell was
                    also measured to determine the noise tolerance of the cell during the write operation. Monte Carlo simulation
                    results verified how robust the proposed cell is. The design was implemented in a 45-nm technology in which the
                    cell occupies 4.53×4.53 µm2 and the system is 568.55×568.55 µm2. This cell consumes only 0.396 fJ, which is lower
                    than the energy per bit consumed on the 6T conventional cell which is 7.265 fJ. All-corner simulation results show
                    that the proposed cell is suitable for low-power applications.

                Due to the demand for IoT technologies, the concept of CPS was explored in this paper.
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    CPS refers to the coordination and communication of physical processes and computing elements connecting 
                    the physical and digital worlds. With the increasing number of smart buildings, the researchers considered 
                    the automation control of various facilities in a smart building which are air conditioning, lighting, and 
                    surveillance systems for sustainability. With this, the researchers acquired and analyzed the STEER Hub building’s 
                    layout diagram as the basis of a smart building design. It was verified and evaluated by an ocular visit, and the 
                    total number of existing system devices for air conditioning, lighting, and surveillance was 313. Wireless access 
                    points connect these devices to the internet. The network architecture was designed and simulated in Cisco Packet 
                    Tracer. Meanwhile, the aforementioned systems were modeled and simulated in MATLAB® and Simulink®. A digital signal,
                    signifying the On/Off condition, serves as the output of the air conditioning and lighting systems. Meanwhile, the 
                    surveillance system’s output is a waveform that compares the motion intensity to a threshold value. The captured 
                    picture displaying the total number of source and captured frames were also presented.

                This paper presents a design of an exoskeleton robot to aid in lower-body rehabilitation of patients who have trouble with walking.
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    The robot is intended for people who suffered from spinal cord injuries, brain trauma, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease,
                    and stroke. Specifically, a robot for rehabilitation can aid therapists and patients by letting the robot lead the walking
                    pattern of the patient. ErgoFellow, SoliWorks, and MATLAB were the software used to design and simulate the robot.
                    Linear stress analysis was done to determine the response of the parts and assemblies to different types of forces.
                    The stress analysis gave the result of Von Mises stress which helped determine the forces the robot can withstand. 
                    Model-based design work flow was done to simulate and visualize the movement of the robot. Through this simulation,
                    the visualization of how the robot will move in a real walking platform was effectively visualized.

                    However, most present designs either suffer from high area cost or low hardware usage.
                    This paper presents a design of a digital logic accelerator (DLA) for use in PBs (processing block)
                    of an opto-electrical neural network (OENN). The proposed DLA uses processing elements that detects
                    underflow and overflow. Besides, it also increased the processing time to resolve the timing problems.
                    The details of the design together with post-layout simulations are presented in this paper. The DLA is 
                    implemented using a typical 40-nm CMOS process. It showed a performance result of 51.2 GOPS and the power 
                    consumption is 91.3 mW at 125 MHz.

                An ultra-low power thermoelectric harvester implemented in 45nm CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) process is presented in this paper. 
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    With the increasing demand of using low voltage portable devices and wireless systems,
                    energy harvesting has become an attractive approach to overcome the problems correlated with
                    battery life and power source and TEG (Thermoelectric Generator) is the most commonly used among
                    different types of energy scavengers. The input of the system will be coming from a TEG with a
                    minimum input voltage of 100mV and will have an output of 1V (unregulated). The architecture for
                    boosting such extremely low voltages is based on a modified Dickson charge pump using ring oscillator
                    as clock signals. The ring oscillator is designed to operate in the subthreshold region employing a
                    forward body bias design technique.

                A 6.25-MHz 3.4-mW Single Clock DPWM Technique Using Matrix Shift Array
            </h3>

            <!-- Collapsible Text -->
            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 text-sm">
                Recent digital pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) researches use multiple clock inputs and long D flip-flop (DFF) arrays,
                which makes scaling to different DPWM frequencies challenging. 
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    This brief demonstrates a DPWM that utilizes a single clock and a Matrix shift array, allowing it to be scaled
                    to any frequency and reducing the effects of clock skew. It has a clock gating technique that selects a specific
                    row of DFFs based on the required % duty cycle. The DPWM design has a dead time generator to prevent shoot-throughs.
                    The DPWM has been fabricated using UMC 180-nm CMOS process. The performance and functionality of the DPWM have been
                    verified through the measured comparisons of % duty ratio, dead time ( Tdt ), and output frequency ( fout ) at input
                    clock frequency ( fclkin ) equal to 10 ∼ 100 MHz. The DPWM design has a maximum % duty ratio of 90.6%, Tdt = 1.8 ns,
                    and fout = 6.25 MHz with 3.4-mW power consumption at fclkin = 100 MHz.

                Memory arrays such as SRAM cells are responsible to the high-power consumption of modern digital systems.  
                <span x-show="expanded">
                    This investigation proposed an SRAM utilizing an ultra-low power cell, implemented using the 16-nm FinFET CMOS
                    technology. Voltage supply selection of the static RAM cells is done by gating the wordline (WL) enable.
                    In standby mode, the cell wordline is not activated, where the cell operates on a lower voltage level so
                    that the stored bit status is still retained. On the other hand, the normal mode is activated when the 
                    wordline of the cell is enabled. Theoretical derivations, all-PVT-corner post-layout simulations, and measurement
                    results were provided for verification of the functionality and performance. An SRAM of 1-kb capacity is designed
                    based on the propose cell. The on-silicon measurement demonstrates 0.006832 fJ (energy/bit) at 500 MHz clock rate
                    and 0.8 V supply.
